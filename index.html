          <p>With this project, we present just a few of the connections 
             between the varied events, people, ideals and places that make 
             up the British Empire.  By zeroing in on the domain as it 
             transitions from an Empire of Liberty to New Imperialism, an 
             overall picture emerges: We see a nation struggling to define 
             itself in a new, global world.  The Britons attempt to reconcile 
             the ideals of freedom and liberty they hold so dear with the 
             reality of a strong, imperial kingdom. The result is an 
             interesting paradox.
          <p>The web presented displays just a fraction of the potential 
             connections between these snippets of Empire. Studying a period 
             of transition offers room to explore new possibilities and 
             linkages. We urge you to draw your own ties between the events 
             outlined, and others, to create a unique picture.

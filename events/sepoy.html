          <p>When British officials presented Hindu and Muslim soldiers with 
             rifle cartridges greased by cow and pig fat, rebellion ensued.  
             Sometimes known as the "First War of Independence" to the Indians, 
             The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 was a watershed point in British 
             imperial history.
             
          <p>Prior to the mutiny, India was a divided nation, under the 
             sovereignty of various monarchies and empires, including the once
             powerful Mughal Empire.  The 
             <a href="../people-groups/eastIndiaCompany.html">British East 
             India Company</a> presided over the domain, its involvement 
             differing from region to region. The company retained its control 
             with standing armies comprised of native "sepoys" under the rule 
             of British officers.  In the wake 
             of the Battle of Plessy in 1757, the British began a policy of 
             slightly more direct rule, annexing territories as rulers were 
             deemed "incompetent" and sending armies to new lands.  The 
             rebellion was sparked when a new musket was distributed to the 
             troops.  This new weapon needed to be loaded manually so its 
             cartridges were greased to make the process faster.  With the 
             religious ramifications of cow and pig fat unbeknownst to the 
             British officials, the soldiers were ordered to load their 
             weapons.  The outraged sepoys laid siege but were soon crushed by 
             British troops.  After the mutiny, control of India moved from the 
             private to public sphere.  The crown took control of the land, 
             making

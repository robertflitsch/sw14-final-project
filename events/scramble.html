        <h3>
          <p>Between 1881 and the beginning of World War I, European nations
             pushed into Africa in competition for land and resources.  The 
             movement began with Belgium's occupation of the 
             <a href="../places/congo.html">Congo</a> and the 
             British involvement in the construction of the 
             <a href="../places/suezCanal.html">Suez Canal</a> and 
             then took off rapidly, each European state struggling to stake 
             his claim.  In a true display of 
             "<a href="../ideals/newImperialism.html">New Imperialism</a>," 
             the countries 
             began to impose more direct control of their conquered nations 
             with imported government and settlers.
          
          <p>This veritable stampede for land was legitimized with the 
             <a href="../events/berlinConference.html">Berlin Conference</a> 
             when the European powers got together to carve up the 
             continent.  Though most of the Western powers were represented in 
             the conference, not a single African diplomat was present.  By the
             end of the process, virtually every inch of Africa (with the 
             exception of Liberia and Ethiopia) was in the hands of a foreign 
             power.
             
          <p>Because of the moral implications of the New Imperialist movement,
             the British and other European governments taking over the 
             continent felt themselves in the right.  They were on a grand 
             mission to civilize this far corner of the world.  Though some 
             backlash by authors and politicians such as 
             <a href="../people-groups/conrad.html">Joseph Conrad</a> did 
             follow the process, powerful figures like 
             <a href="../people-groups/rhodes.html">Cecil Rhodes</a> and 
             <a href="../people-groups/chamberlain.html">Joseph Chamberlain</a>
             dominated the public opinion and held Britain largely in the 
             right.</h3>
